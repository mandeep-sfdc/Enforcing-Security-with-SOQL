**Enforcing Security with SOQL

When you attempt to access data in Apex through a SOQL query, you can query all fields on all objects because Apex runs in system context. So during code execution, the current user's permissions, field-level security, and sharing rules arenâ€™t taken into account.

Difference between 

>> SOQL WITHOUT SECURITY_ENFORCED, 
>> SOQL WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED and
>> SOQL WITH STRIPINACCESSIBLE
